level of observation 
- Competing individual
- Competition
Tables:
- IMO table
  - Is country-level necessary?
  - Sometimes discrepancy on what is missing. Country results or individual results.
- Nobel price winners
  - What level of observation? --> Countries: Average number of prizes per year per capita(/10M)
    - Before and after the competition time slices
  - Possibly sum of individuals based on birth country and affiliation country (2 separate variables)
  - Birth country --> per capita/year
  - Affiliation country --> we will see
- Other sums?
- Weather data
  - Averaged per competition OK
- Macro data DONE (almost)
  - Average of markers for the 10 years prior? OK
  - Year preceding
      - OR: latest non-empty year
  - And before-after.
  - Needs some formatting yet 
      - widen table to distinguish variables, but country year is still in long format
      - Then aggregate over time
